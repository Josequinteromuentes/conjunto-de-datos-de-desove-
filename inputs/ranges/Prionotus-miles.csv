"To get individual probabilities (i.e. Depth, Temperature, Salinity, Primary Production, Sea Ice Concentration, Distance to Land):"
1. Click on the Create-Your-Own-Map at the bottom left part of the species map page.
2. Click on the Regenerate Map Data and View Map button then click OK.
3. In the resulting User-Specified Map for the species click on the Download data (as csv) link.
4. Select HSPEC then Submit.
